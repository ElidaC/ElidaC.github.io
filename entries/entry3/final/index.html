				<h2>Mood</h2>

				<p>Red like a rushing</p>

				<p> passionate heart is pounding rapidly. Each heartbeat</p>
				<p> carries passion and hope, tirelessly warming our souls and</p>
				<p> igniting the flames. Sometimes, it's hard to understand why such
				<p> a sharp-edged color can become a symbol of love, but both giving and</p>
				<p> receiving love require that spark of impulsiveness and passion.</p>

				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp sometimes make people overly conspicuous, 
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp leading to anxiety and unease.  
					<br>
					<br>
				<p>Like a passionate storm, red can bring about restlessness and agitation.  
				<p>Yet, this very contrast makes red so striking and impossible to ignore when it 
				<p>appears in every corner of our lives. Whether it shines brightly or remains quietly 
				<p>subdued, red possesses its unique charm, deeply embedded in our existence.

				<h2>Red in</h2>
				<h2>Culture</h2>
				<p>In Chinese culture, 
				<p>the color red carries 
				<p>rich blessings and well 
				<p>wishes. It symbolizes 
				<p>celebrations, 
				<p>reunions, 
				<p>and
				<p>the
				<p>New Year, 
				<p>representing 
				<p>deep wishes for 
				<p>family and friends. 
				<p>During the Chinese New Year, 
				<p>people wear red clothing, hang up 
				<p>red couplets and "fu" characters, and 
				<p>give red envelopes to children, all of which 
				<p>convey care and love for their loved ones.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  
				</p>
				<p>Red is also the color of the Chinese national &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
				<p> flag, symbolizing the nation's passion &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
				<p> and courage. It inspires people &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
				<p> undeterred to move forward &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
				<p> bravely, by challenges.  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
				<p> Additionally, it &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

				<h2>Have you heard about Red Funeral?</h2>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p id="paral1">Red funerals are</p>
				<p>not a common form
				<p>of funeral 
				<p>that
				<p>challenges 
				<p>perceptions of 
				<p>traditional funerals 
				<p>and are usually arranged 
				<p>according to the 
				<p>personal wishes 
				<p>of the 
				<p>deceased
				<p>or 
				<p>family 
				<p>to honor
				<p>their beliefs, 
				<p>culture, and views 
				<p>of life and values. 
				<p>This form of funeral 
				<p>may not be for 
				<p>everyone, 
				<p>but it 
				<p>may 
				<p>be an 
				<p>appropriate 
				<p>way for those 
				<p>who want to honor 
				<p>the deceased by 
				<p>celebrating life
				<p>rather than 
				<p>just 
				<p>mourning.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>In my imagination, 
				<p>red funerals 
				<p>suit soldiers, 
				<p>martyrs, 
				<p>and 
				<p>martial 
				<p>arts practitioners.
				<p> Still, I didn't 
				<p>realize that 
				<p>many 
				<p>ordinary 
				<p>people would 
				<p>like to send their 
				<p>families off this way 2. 
					<br>
				<p>In 2009, there was a 
				<p>news report about 
				<p>a 103-year-old 
				<p>woman who 
				<p>died, 
				<p>and 
				<p>her children 
				<p>and grandchildren 
				<p>rolled out a red carpet 
				<p>and hung red lanterns 
				<p>at the funeral home
				<p>to honor the death
				<p>of their mother. 
				<p>Because they  
				<p>thought
				<p>their 
				<p>mother, 
				<p>who had 
				<p>lived to be
				<p>100 years old 
				<p>and died without 
				<p>any illness, 
				<p>they should 
				<p>treat the 
				<p>funeral 
				<p>as a 
				<p>happy 
				<p>event
				<p>to show
				<p>appreciation
				<p>and 
				<p>respect.
