				<h2>Mood</h2>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>Red like a rushing</p>
				<p>torrent, surging forth with</p>
				<p>boundless courage. It is the pulse of</p> 
				<p>life, beating with infinite vitality, as if a</p>
				<p> passionate heart is pounding rapidly. Each heartbeat</p>
				<p> carries passion and hope, tirelessly warming our souls and</p>
				<p> igniting the flames. Sometimes, it's hard to understand why such
				<p> a sharp-edged color can become a symbol of love, but both giving and</p>
				<p> receiving love require that spark of impulsiveness and passion.</p>

				<p>&nbsp &nbsp Whether in the blazing flames of love or the relentless</p>
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp pursuit of our dreams, red empowers us and</p> 
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp inspires the courage to embrace</p> 
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp every moment of life.</p>
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It allows us</p>
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp to feel</p>
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the </p>
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp boundless</p>
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp energy possibilities</p> 
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp between sunrise and sunset,</p>
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp encouraging us to embrace</p> 
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp the world passionality.</p>
				<p>Many seek red because it
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp makes them stand out or :D
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp represents self-confidence and 
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp blessings. This world is so beautifully
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp diverse; red is the most vibrant hue.........
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp However, red can also be a burden. It may 
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp sometimes make people overly conspicuous, 
				<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp leading to anxiety and unease.  
					<br>
					<br>
				<p>Like a passionate storm, red can bring about restlessness and agitation.  
				<p>Yet, this very contrast makes red so striking and impossible to ignore when it 
				<p>appears in every corner of our lives. Whether it shines brightly or remains quietly 
				<p>subdued, red possesses its unique charm, deeply embedded in our existence.

				<h2>Have you heard about Red Funeral?</h2>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p id="paral1">Red funerals are</p>
				<p>not a common form
				<p>of funeral 
				<p>that
				<p>challenges 
				<p>perceptions of 
				<p>traditional funerals 
				<p>and are usually arranged 
				<p>according to the 
				<p>personal wishes 
				<p>of the 
				<p>deceased
				<p>or 
				<p>family 
				<p>to honor
				<p>their beliefs, 
				<p>culture, and views 
				<p>of life and values. 

				<p>However, in this page, 
				<p>"red funeral" shows
				<p>my reaction to 
				<p>the color.
				<p>Personally, 
				<p>red is my least 
				<p>favorite color in  
				<p>the world.
				<p>It makes me 
				<p>feel so irritated 
				<p>that I can't 
				<p>concentrate 
				<p>on 
				<p>anything.
